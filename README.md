# elk
A really simple programming language written in JavaScript as a little excercise

# Syntax
Elk has a very Lisp like syntax (kind of) which means it uses Polish Notation<br>
for example when adding 2 and 2 in most languages it would be. ``2+2`` but in Elk<br>
it is ``+ 2 2`` this is what Polish notation is. I have tried to base almost all<br>
of the syntax off this Polish notation with exceptions in a few places<br>
